This sample uses tiled cubemaps, which are stored as follows:
Each subresource (face/MIP) is stored as a grid of row-major tiles.
Subresources are ordered according to standard Direct3D ordering.
Subresources with sizes less than the format's standard tile shape are padded to a full tile.
Code to calculate a byte offset from a D3D11_TILED_RESOURCE_COORDINATE can be found in TileLoader.cpp.
